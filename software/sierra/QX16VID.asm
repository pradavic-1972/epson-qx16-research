; ============================================================================
; QX16SCI.DRV - SCI0 640x400 monochrome driver for Epson QX-16
; Derived from the PC1.DRV source supplied by the user.
;
; Target:
;   Epson QX-16, 8088 compatible CPU with APX-ICRT
;   QX-16 native VM6 640x400 monochrome mode
;
; Confirmed QX mode-2 plane mapping:
;   8000h = Blue
;   8008h = Red
;   9000h = Green
;
; SCI framebuffer:
;   320x200, packed 4-bit pixels, two pixels per byte, 160 bytes/row
;
; Conversion:
;   Four SCI pixels (two source bytes) become one QX byte in 0each plane.
;   0Each SCI pixel is doubled horizontally:
;       pixel 0 -> bits 7,6 (0C0h)
;       pixel 1 -> bits 5,4 (30h)
;       pixel 2 -> bits 3,2 (0Ch)
;       pixel 3 -> bits 1,0 (03h)
;
; SCI color bits:
;   bit 0 = Blue
;   bit 1 = Green
;   bit 2 = Red
;   bit 3 = Intensity
;
; Intensity approximation:
;   One pixel of 0each doubled pair is forced white for colors 8-15.
;
; BUILD:
;   nasm -f bin -o QX11SCI.DRV QX11SCI.ASM
;
; NOTE:
;   This version builds one scanline worth of Blue/Red/Green bytes in
;   temporary buffers, then copies 0each whole buffer to VRAM. This avoids
;   changing ES for every generated QX byte. The pixel converter uses
;   precomputed 256-byte lookup tables, row copies use MOVSW where possible,
;   and cursor redraw is limited to rectangles that overlap the cursor.
